Rachel Sowa is a 2017 graduate of the CCS Computer Science program, originally from Livermore, California. Her interests include applications of Computer Science to music and media arts, including making electronic musical instruments and multicolored LED interfaces with Arduino and Max/MSP. Studying in CCS gave her the opportunity to take courses in the Media Arts and Technology graduate program at UCSB and explore topics such as sound synthesis, media signal processing, and audiovisual performance. During the summer of 2015, she did an internship at Sonos in downtown Santa Barbara, where she worked on developing a platform for the QA team to test state transitions in the speakers’ setup wizard software. In addition to studying Computer Science, Rachel also double minored in Music and German. She played in the UCSB Horn Studio and studied French horn with Dr. Steven Gross. Through the UCSB Education Abroad Program, she spent the summer of 2016 in Berlin, Germany, taking classes in social media and business innovation management at the Technische Universität Berlin.

Rachel currently does software development for Codame, a San Francisco art and tech non-profit aimed at fostering connections between artists, musicians, and members of the tech community. During her free time, she enjoys tinkering around with fun Arduino sensors, reading books in German, and tending to her expanding houseplant collection.
